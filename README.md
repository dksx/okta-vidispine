# Okta React + Custom Login Example

This example shows you how to use the [Okta React Library](https://github.com/okta/okta-oidc-js/tree/master/packages/okta-react) and [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router) to login a user to a React application.  The login is achieved with the [Okta Sign In Widget](https://github.com/okta/okta-signin-widget), which gives you more control to customize the login experience within your app.

This example is built with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
